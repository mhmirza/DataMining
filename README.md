# DataMining

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Data Mining**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. To view my GitHub repository, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/DataMining). The work done here involves discovering structure and making predictions in large, complex data sets. The tasks encompass learnings about many commonly used methods for predictive and descriptive analytics tasks, in addition to assessing the methods' predictive and practical utility.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Data Mining, I wish to learn how to run commonly used data mining methods in R, complemented by an understanding of their advantages & disadvantages, which can be uncovered by comparing the utility of different methods through various types of assignments. In addition, I hope to use practical datasets to navigate through the various stages of model building such as feature selection, model evaluation and resampling to assess the performance & reliability of these methods.

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** Using data from a [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) survey executed by our team in Pittsburgh, the paper explores the causal effect of including scooter rides as part of the university transportation fee on weekly scooter usage. The causal inference in this scenario is established due to the elimination of selection bias, which was achieved through random assignment of experimental subjects to the treatment and control group. Moreover, the analysis extends to explore heterogeneity in the average causal effect across groups within the sample using key barriers of distance, safety and income as moderators. The project consisted of the following parts: Experiment Design & Causal Question of Interest; Survey Design & Execution; Data & Analysis and Recommendations.
