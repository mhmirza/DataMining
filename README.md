# DataMining

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Data Mining**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. To view my GitHub repository, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/DataMining). The work done here involves discovering structure and making predictions in large, complex data sets. The tasks encompass learnings about many commonly used methods for predictive and descriptive analytics tasks, in addition to assessing the methods' predictive and practical utility.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Data Mining, I wish to learn how to run commonly used data mining methods in R, along with weighing their advantages & disadvantages by comparing their utility through various types of assignments below. In addition, I hope to use real-world datasets to navigate through various stages of model building such as feature selection, model evaluation and resampling to assess the performance & reliability of these methods.
