# DataMining

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Data Mining**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. To view my GitHub repository, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/DataMining). The work done here involves fundamentals of randomized control trials (a.k.a. A/B tests), namely what they achieve, how to design, implement and analyze their outcomes as well as their shortcomings and work arounds. The assignments and project completed below also leverage the tools that can be used to analyze data from observational studies where randomization can not be implemented. The course uses examples with real-world datasets drawn from research performed at the Heinz College in entertainment and education.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, A/B Testing Design & Implementation, I wish to garner an understanding of causality and the appropriate language to ask and answer causal questions. In addition to the theoretical knowledge, I intend to learn how the intuition is developed for implementation using fundamental tools required to measure causal effects. The following concepts have been covered in the assignments below: _Randomized Control Experiments; Time and Individual Fixed Effects; Instrumental Variables; Natural Experiments; Differences in Differences; Propensity Score Matching; Compliance in Experiments; Heterogeneous Effects; Interference in Networked Experiments._

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** Using data from a [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) survey executed by our team in Pittsburgh, the paper explores the causal effect of including scooter rides as part of the university transportation fee on weekly scooter usage. The causal inference in this scenario is established due to the elimination of selection bias, which was achieved through random assignment of experimental subjects to the treatment and control group. Moreover, the analysis extends to explore heterogeneity in the average causal effect across groups within the sample using key barriers of distance, safety and income as moderators. The project consisted of the following parts: Experiment Design & Causal Question of Interest; Survey Design & Execution; Data & Analysis and Recommendations.
